# README - TODO APP

This is a basic To-Do application built using Python (Flask), JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality and uses SQLAlchemy with SQLite3 for database management.

## Live Demo

You can check out the live version of the app here: [Live To-Do App](https://icekingroyale.pythonanywhere.com/)


## Description

The To-Do app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by performing the following actions:
- **Create** a new task.
- **Read** and view all tasks.
- **Update** an existing task.
- **Delete** a task once it's complete or no longer needed.

The app is designed with a clean and simple user interface to enhance productivity and task management.
